# Ofero Network: Community Manager Role

## Role Overview
A Community Manager in the Ofero Network plays a crucial role in nurturing, growing, and engaging a community. Once a community on ofero.me reaches 1,000 verified members, a Community Manager is appointed. This individual drives local participation, fosters a positive environment, and works closely with the broader Ofero ecosystem to ensure alignment with the network’s goals.

## Responsibilities
- Implement community growth strategies to increase engagement and reach local network goals.
- Coordinate local marketing initiatives, utilizing allocated budgets effectively.
- Assist community members in understanding and navigating the [ofero.me](https://ofero.me) platform, including helping new members get validated.
- Maintain clear, consistent communication channels, listening to member feedback and addressing concerns.
- Collaborate with the Country Manager (if applicable) and other Ofero representatives to ensure the community’s interests are represented at higher governance levels.
- Host regular events, workshops, or educational sessions to keep the community informed and involved.

## Minimum Requirements
- Must have demonstrated dedication to building and supporting the Ofero community.
- Must be active, responsive, and capable of guiding community conversations.
- No election required; the role is appointed once the community meets membership criteria.

## Community Creation Cost  

- Establishing a local community under the Ofero Network umbrella costs $500 USD. A community leader must first create and populate their community before formal recognition.

## Compensation
- At the start of each month, the Community Manager receives $5,000 in OFE Tokens (unlocked), allocated for marketing and community-building initiatives.
- If the price of OFE is below $1, monthly compensation is capped at 5,000 OFE.
- Funds are allocated monthly from the Ofero Operations Wallet.
