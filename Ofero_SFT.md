# Ofero Network: The Ofero SFT

## Overview
The Ofero Network’s Semi-Fungible Token (SFT) model is designed to align token valuation with the total OFE supply, ensuring that holders benefit from the network’s overall growth. SFT holders receive sustainable rewards, have a direct voice in governance decisions, and gain VIP status within the community.

## SFT Valuation and Rewards

- **Valuation**:  
  Each SFT is conceptually tied to a valuation of 450,000 OFE, aligning its worth directly with the entire Ofero Network token supply.

- **APR**:  
  SFT holders earn an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of 8.4%, calculated on the 450,000 OFE valuation per SFT. This structure promotes long-term engagement and network stability.

- **Single Staking Mechanism**:  
  SFTs are the sole staking option within the Ofero Network, simplifying participation and rewards distribution.

## Rewards Funding and Stability

- **Accumulator Nexus Wallet**:  
  All network profits flow into the Accumulator Nexus Wallet. Profits are then distributed exclusively to SFT holders, ensuring the community directly benefits from the network’s operational success.

- **Aegis Wallet**:  
  The Aegis Wallet serves as a safety net:
  - If the network generates no profit over a full year, a 6% APR minimum is guaranteed.
  - If profits are insufficient to achieve the target 8.4% APR, the Aegis Wallet covers the shortfall, ensuring holders receive up to 8.4%.

## Governance and Participation

- **Verification**:  
  SFT holders must register and verify their profiles on [ofero.me](https://ofero.me) to access rewards and governance privileges.

- **Unique Holders for Governance**:  
  Ofero aims to have at least 800 unique SFT holders involved in governance by July 1, 2026. Each verified participant may use only one SFT for governance to maintain fairness.

- **Annual Governance Meetups (Ofero Summit)**:  
  Starting in 2026, Ofero hosts annual in-person governance events in locations chosen by community vote. During these meetups, SFT holders:
  - Discuss and vote on strategic decisions (e.g., leadership appointments, marketing strategies).
  - Participate either in-person or remotely via the governance dashboard on [ofero.me](https://ofero.me).

- **Ofero Summit**:  
  The initial annual meetup is scheduled for August 16–23, 2026, with the host location selected on March 7, 2026.
