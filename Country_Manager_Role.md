# Ofero Network: Country Manager Role

## Role Overview
A Country Manager serves as the primary representative and strategist for the Ofero Network within a specific country. Once a country’s verified members on [ofero.me](https://ofero.me) exceed 5,000, a Country Manager is elected by SFT holders. This individual is responsible for driving community growth, implementing marketing initiatives, and ensuring alignment with the Ofero Network’s values and long-term objectives.
